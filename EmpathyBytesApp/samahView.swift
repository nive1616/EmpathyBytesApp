However, when she learned she would be forced to live in the dorms despite health and safety concerns, she decided it would be best for her to continue to attend Georgia State University, where she had dual-enrolled in high school.  Like many first-year students, Khan felt deeply disconnected from the campus community at Georgia State when attending courses online.  Unfortunately, when the Fall 2021 semester, came and Khan attended courses in person, she still was not convinced that Georgia State was the right fit for her.  Khan describes her mother pushing her to pursue a degree from Georgia Tech, as many of their close friends graduated from Georgia Tech.  She describes submitting her transfer application partially to appease her mother, but when she received her acceptance letter, she decided Georgia Tech was going to become her new place of study.  We spoke to Khan in early February, and she had loved her first month at Georgia Tech.  To hear more about Khanâ€™s journey to Georgia Tech and experience beginning college from her childhood bedroom, check back to find her video interview.")
