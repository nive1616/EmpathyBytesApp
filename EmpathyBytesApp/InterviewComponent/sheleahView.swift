Harris grew up in Athens and chose to forego an education at the University of Georgia to attend Georgia Tech in pursuit of a bachelor's degree in Computational Media (abbreviated as CM).  The CM program is not offered at very many universities in the United States, and Georgia Tech is the only school in the state to offer such a degree.  For Harris, the choice was straightforward, Georgia Tech offered an excellent education in any field, and Computational Media is no exception.  With that said, the journey through Tech presented Harris with challenges personally, academically, and athletically.  Harrisâ€™ first year of collegiate track competition was anything, but normal.  She describes her experiences at meets where athletes remained separated from each other, masked, and constantly waiting to receive negative COVID tests.  The entire experience feels incredibly surreal, and one can only imagine how deeply this affected athletes' mental game.  Harris describes a particularly, heartbreaking experience in which she was about to compete in the indoor ACC Championships, and received notice that she had been contact traced and had to return home for the health and safety of all athletes, coaches, and event staff.  The video interview with Harris is still underwork but check back to hear more about her experiences as a college athlete in the midst of a global pandemic.")
